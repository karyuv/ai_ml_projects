    "# Statistical NLP\n",
    "- In the previous section, we read more on cleaning up the data.\n",
    "- But the focus is now is to convert data from unstructured to structured \n",

    "##  TF-IDF:\n",
    "- TF-IDF is a scheme to weigh individual tokens.\n",
    "- This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents or corpus.\n",
    "- TF-IDF weighs words by the frequency of appearance within a document but penalizes words that appear across many documents.\n",
    "- The concept is that words appearing many times in a single document are likely noteworthy, but they could also just be common words that appear frequently in all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bow:\n",
    "- The Bag of Words (BoW) model is the simplest form of text representation in numbers.\n",
    "- Like the term itself, we can represent a sentence as a bag of words vector (a string of numbers).\n",
    "- The BoW model retains neither information on the grammar of the sentences nor the ordering of the words in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing TF-IDF and Bow:\n",
    "- Bag of Words just creates a set of vectors containing the count of word occurrences in the document (reviews), while the TF-IDF model contains information on the more important words and the less important ones as well.\n",
    "- Bag of Words vectors is easy to interpret. However, TF-IDF usually performs better in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disads of Bow Model:\n",
    "- If the new sentences contain new words, then our vocabulary size would increase, and thereby, the length of the vectors would increase too.\n",
    "- Additionally, the vectors would also contain many zeros, thereby resulting in a sparse matrix (which is what we would like to avoid).\n",
    "- We are retaining no information on the grammar of the sentences nor the ordering of the words in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vader\n",
    "- VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. \n",
    "- VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Word representations\n",
    "## Document term matrix (DTM)\n",
    "- A matrix where cols are the words present in the corpus. Where the rows are the documents itself. (note: also Sunil is not equal to sunil in the text, capital letter differ)\n",
    "- What does each cell in the DTM contains:\n",
    "   - count vectorizer: (Bow vectorizer)\n",
    "       - Where each cell contains the event of number of times the word appeared in the document corpus.\n",
    "   - tf-idf vectorizer:\n",
