    "# WHAT IS NLP?\n",
    "The class of techniques used to process and understand various aspects of unstructured text data, is called Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why?\n",
    "We have studied, extracted information (EDA), and built models using numerical and image data so far. However, the vast majority of data in the world today is text within unstructured data - which constitutes up to 80% of the total data generated in the world these days. The rise in data and computing power has driven tremendous developments in the machine learning space, and the need to access and process text data is turning out to be increasingly significant with regards to solving real-life/business problems\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some applications\n",
    " Some of the products/applications of NLP in life and business are Chatbots, Virtual assistants (Ex: Siri, Alexa), Text classification/categorization, Sentiment analysis, Machine translation, Speech recognition, Text summarization and Autocorrect. NLP applications are also used to analyze customer behavior (Customer analytics) and derive marketing intelligence.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Data format\n",
    "Data will be unstructured. Not in tabular format. There are also libraries avaibale to do NLP in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some challenges of NLP\n",
    "-  Contextual words and phrases and homonyms\n",
    "- Synonyms\n",
    "- Irony and sarcasm\n",
    "- Ambiguity\n",
    "- Errors in text or speech\n",
    "- Colloquialisms and slang\n",
    "- Domain-specific language\n",
    "- Low-resource languages\n",
    "- Lack of research and development\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a trio of linguistic, AI and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some applications\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment analysis\n",
    "- Looks at review comments and categorizes it as +ve or -ve comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine translation\n",
    "- Translate language from  one format to other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part of speech tags\n",
    "Pull certain meta info from the text. For example, pull all names from a paragraph\n",
    "## Human machine communication\n",
    "- Basically the communication between the human and machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why study NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- not get stuck with structured data processing.\n",
    "- very critical skill\n",
    "\n",
    "# Text classification\n",
    "- for example, take in customer request and put into an appropriate bin (like service bin or complain bin etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "# word segmentation\n",
    "Segmentation in NLP mans, segment the data into certain meta. For example, segment the texts into paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# why NLP is hard?\n",
    "- languages are evolving.\n",
    "- each language is unique.\n",
    "- also usage of word depends on context. \"i like books\", \"book the ticket please\".\n",
    "- also each language is spoken different in different regions and countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Std NLP terms\n",
    "-  Corpus: A body of text samples (in real world, this is the document).\n",
    "- Document: A text sample\n",
    "- Vocabulary: A list of words used in the corpus.\n",
    "- Language model: How the words are supposed to be organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some pre-processing steps\n",
    "- remove unecessary punctuations\n",
    "- fix spelling mistake\n",
    "- some clean up, junk etc\n",
    "- this clean up is called text-pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some frameworks\n",
    "- NLTK: Natural language tool kit (for cleaning up, text into tabular format). It is not production grade.\n",
    "- Beautiful soup: used to scrap data from the web\n",
    "- Text blob: provided additional functionality which is not available in NLTK. Text blob helps to achieve translation (uses google api).\n",
    "- Spacy: Industry version of NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Continue on pre-processsing\n",
    "- remove unwanted special characters\n",
    "- remove stop words : this reduces the processing time. \n",
    "- But can not be applied to all examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stemming\n",
    "- Convert all the extraploated forms of the word (for example ran, running runs will be changed to its base \"run\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- can be done by removing sufixes and prefixes.\n",
    "- advantage is reducing the dims in the text.\n",
    "- but it may resut in words which is not even in dictionary (because it does not check). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Lemmatization\n",
    "- very similar to stemming.\n",
    "- ensures that the resultant word is part of the dictionary.\n",
    "- it is time consuming, hence if not crtitical, people ususally go for stemming\n",
    "\n"
