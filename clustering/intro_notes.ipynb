    "# Types of clustering\n",
    "## Connectivity based clustering\n",
    " - Look at every pair of points, objects\n",
    " - Then do clustering based on that.\n",
    " - computaionally expensive, since its considers every combination\n",
    " - n*(n+1)/2 (quadractically)\n",
    " - visualization done by **Dendograms**.\n",
    " - Flexible to work with.\n",
    " - Has a top down approach, because you start with independent objects and then just group them\n",
    " - no need for any input other than the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Centroid based clustering (eg.: k means clustering)\n",
    " - Beging by calculating 5 times the samples.\n",
    " - scales by 5*n (linearly)\n",
    " - Works by:\n",
    "   - assign 2 center points\n",
    "   - then group points based on the distance between the 2 center points.\n",
    "   - Larger k (the number of groups) produces smaller groups.\n",
    "   - Smaller k, produces larger groups.\n",
    " - starts with k (estimate on number of groups)\n",
    "     - then assign k center points\n",
    "     - estimate the distance of other points from the center.\n",
    "     - if the 2 points are closer to center, then its means they are similar.\n",
    " - Lloyd's algorithm\n",
    " - Elbow plot (elbow method)\n",
    "    - To estimate the k for compression and accuracy.\n",
    "    - k=1 means max compression and maybe less accuracy.\n",
